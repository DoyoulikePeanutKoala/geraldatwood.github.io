## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/geraldatwood/geraldatwood.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### My Website

I'm currently just using this to host a twitter app. If you're just reading this because you stumbled onto my account, thanks for dropping by!
